# LaserMatGUI
This package implements a simple GUI to perform test on the model. It does not process any images, but evaluate the model given you own triangulation system data.

### Documantation
The main GUI has two button, one to perform the triangulation model, the other to perform the diameter model. Both the GUI needed a configuration file with all the values of interest. A default file is opened when you open the GUI. Fell free to change these two files.
Accordingly with the choosen model, there are some other parameters to set before to evaluate the two models.
