# LaserMat
LaserMat is a computer vision library written in MatLab, thought for laser triangulation-based systems. It allows to calibrate the system using [Tsai] calibration algorithm, to conveter the coordinate from the image referece system to the world referece system and vice-versa. Furthermore, it contains some filters for image and laser processing.
