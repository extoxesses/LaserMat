  abstract = { Range data can play an important role in industrial inspection and quality assurance. We analyse the issues of calibration, stripe location and measurement consistency in low-cost, triangulation-based range sensors using structured laser light. We adopt a direct calibration technique which does not require modelling any specific sensor component or phenomenon, and therefore is not limited in accuracy by the inability to model error sources. We compare five algorithms for determining the location of the stripe in the images with subpixel accuracy. We describe data consistency tests based on two-camera geometry, which make it possible to acquire satisfactory range images of highly reflective surfaces with holes. Finally, we sketch the use of our range sensor within an automatic system for 3-D model acquisition from multiple range images. Experimental results illustrating the various topics accuracy are reported and discussed. }

  abstract = {We discuss the uncertainty limit in distance sensing by laser triangulation. The uncertainty in distance measurement of laser triangulation sensors and other coherent sensors is limited by speckle noise. Speckle arises because of the coherent illumination in combination with rough surfaces. A minimum limit on the distance uncertainty is derived through speckle statistics. This uncertainty is a function of wavelength, observation aperture, and speckle contrast in the spot image. Surprisingly, it is the same distance uncertainty that we obtained from a single-photon experiment and from Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Experiments confirm the theory. An uncertainty principle connecting lateral resolution and distance uncertainty is introduced. Design criteria for a sensor with minimum distance uncertainty are determined: small temporal coherence, small spatial coherence, a large observation aperture.},

  abstract = {We discuss the limits of optical range sensing by shearing interferometry for diffusely reflecting objects. The basic principle is the following: the radius of a wave that is scattered at the object under test is measured by shearing interferometry. This radius is the desired distance. We show that the limits of the method are mainly determined by speckle. With coherent light depth resolution cannot be increased considerably beyond the Rayleigh depth of focus. With partially coherent light a rms depth resolution of 68 $\mu$m at a distance of 380 mm (1:5500) was achieved. This resolution is 25 times better than the Rayleigh limit. The working aperture is very small (0.013); shading problems are minimized.},

  title="Analysis of Tsai calibration method using two- and three-dimensional calibration objects",

  abstract="Camera calibration is a fundamental process for both photogrammetric and computer vision. Since the arrival of the direct linear transformation method and its later revisions, new methods have been developed by several authors, such as: Tsai, Heikkil{\"a} and Zhang. Most of these have been based on the pinhole model, including distortion correction. Some of these methods, such as Tsai method, allow the use of two different techniques for determining calibration parameters: a non-coplanar calibration technique using three-dimensional (3D) calibration objects, and a coplanar technique that uses two-dimensional (2D) calibration objects. The calibration performed by observing a 3D calibration object has good accuracy, and produces very efficient results; however, the calibration object must be accurate enough and requires an elaborate configuration. In contrast, the use of 2D calibration objects yields less accurate results, is much more flexible, and does not require complex calibration objects that are costly to produce. This article compares these two different calibration procedures from the perspective of stereo measurement. Particular attention was focused on the accuracy of the calculated camera parameters, the reconstruction error in the computer image coordinates and in the world coordinate system and advanced image-processing techniques for subpixel detection during the comparison. The purpose of this work is to establish a basis and selection criteria for choosing one of these techniques for camera calibration, according to the accuracy required in each of the many applications using photogrammetric vision: robot calibration methods, trajectory generation algorithms, articulated measuring arm calibration, and photogrammetric systems.",
