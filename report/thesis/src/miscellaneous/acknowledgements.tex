% \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}

At the end of these five years, I would like to thank my parents, Anna Maria and Paolino, who have given me the opportunity to do this experience and that, despite everything, have always been present and have endured all my crises with love.

Then, I would like to thank Marta, who in these years has always been waiting for me, sacrificing our time together.

Last but not least, all my friends, who have made this journey lighter with their presence.

A thank to all those who will read this thesis, with whom I apologize if they find some mistake.
